.SH SYNOPSIS
.B st\-user
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR st\-user
is a helper script for running and reconfiguring
.BR st
if neccessarry.
.P
Running
.BR st\-user
starts the Fedora build by default.  If you wish to customize your
configuration, put your
.BR st
configuration header file to $HOME/.st/config.h and adjust it according to
your needs. The official Fedora configuration file might be a useful template.
See the
.BR FILES
section of this manual.
.P
Every time the user configuration file has changed or new patches have
been added,
.BR st\-user
will rebuild the user
.BR st
binary prior to its execution.
.P
Fedora utilizes
.BR alternatives
to choose whether the system build, also installed as
.BR st\-fedora ,
or the custom build is run.  If available, custom builds are preferred.
